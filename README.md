# Watson Studio Workshop

This repository holds the source material for my Watson Studio Workshop.

For this workshop all the data is in box folder: https://ibm.box.com/v/WatsonWorkshopsLH

If you have allready made IBMid you can skip first part of Lab 1, but if you don't have IBMid you can find instructions there.

It is highly suggested to go through every lab, they are located in **WatStudLabs** folder.


After labs we would love to hear your opinion and we hope you could leave feedback to us. The feedback form is in Box folder. Fill the form and send it to <lasse.huotari@ibm.com>


# Lab Info

## Lab 1 Getting Started

Getting familiar with Watson Studio, how to import data and how to refine and clean it.

## Lab 2 Visualization

Visualization with OpenSource libaries Brunel and PixieDust with Jupyter Notebooks, and overview of Watson Studio reporting capabilities.

## Lab 3 Spark

Spark is powerfull distributed computing environment, which gives the extra punch for your Data Science performance

## Lab 4 Time Series

Lab 4 is all about Time Series prediction with Modeler Flow tool. The easy drag&drop tool gives you powerful Data Science and Machine Learning functions

## Lab 5 Machine Learning

Lab 5 introduces Machine Learning capabilities in Watson Studio by using Jupyter Notebooks, Model builder and Modeler Flow toolset.

## Lab 6 Optimization

Optimization is great tool for making better decisions. In this lab we are using CPLEX with Jupyter Notebooks

## Lab 7 Deep Learning

In the lab 7 we are deep diving into Deep learning world with Visual Recognition Watson API, Jupyter Notebooks and Neural Network Modeler. On top of that we are building our own hand-written digit recognition app with CoreML and Xcode for Apple device

## Lab 8 App development
