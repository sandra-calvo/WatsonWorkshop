# Mall Customer Segmentation

In this tutorial we are using Watson Studio's SPSS Modeler to cluster Mall customer data and Visualize predictions with Data refinery.

We are using sample dataset, which can be found from Kaggle:

[Data](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python "Data")

Download the dataset and import that as a data asset to Watson Studio Project. If you aren't familiar with Watson Studio, please see my first Lab:

[Lab1-Getting Started]https://github.com/LasseHuotari/WatsonWorkshop/tree/master/Lab1-GettingStarted "Lab1")

When you have loaded the dataset open new Modeler Flow from the asset page.
