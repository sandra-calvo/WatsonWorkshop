## Handwritten digit recognition with MNIST on iOS build using IBM Watson Studio & Watson Machine Learning capabilities - Part 1 : for dummies.


This tutorial shows IBM Watson Studio framework capabilities to load training data to the IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) area, create a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that is build and trained with IBM Watson Machine Learning kernel. I´ll show how the model can be exported & integrated in iOS and can be accessed in code (Objective-C in this Tutorial) via the new CoreML and Vision Api introduced by apple for iOS11. 
I trained the model on the MNIST dataset in order to create an app that can recognize handwritten digits.
The iphone application used in this tutorial is from [Eridy Lukau](https://github.com/boaerosuke) accessible at this [URL](https://github.com/boaerosuke/digitrecognition_ios) 


## Introduction
Watson Studio provides you with the environment and tools to solve your business problems by collaboratively working with data. You can choose the tools you need to analyze and visualize data, to cleanse and shape data, to ingest streaming data, or to create, train, and deploy machine learning models.

This illustration shows how the architecture of Watson Studio is centered around the project. A project is where you organize your resources and work with data.


![alt text](images/Watson-Studio.png "IBM WS")


IBM Watson Studio is a collaborative environment with end to end AI tools that you and your team can use to collect and prepare training data, and to design, train, and deploy machine learning models.


Ranging from graphical tools you can use to build a model in minutes, to tools that automate running thousands of experiment training runs and hyperparameter optimization, Watson Studio AI tools support popular frameworks, including: TensorFlow, Caffe, PyTorch, and Keras.
In this first part dedicated to non pure data scientists, we will use Watson Studio graphical tools to :

1. Load & store the training data
0. Model the Artificial Neural Network
0. Run it against the trainign data
0. Score the created model using test/validation data
0. Deploy the model
0. Export it as a CoreML Apple iOS model
0. Embed it into an iphone application

Finally use the application to test your own "finger written" numbers ! 


## 1-Load, Store, Organize your data
First, to access Watson Studio environment, you need your IBM ID. 
Visit [IBM Dataplatform](http://dataplatform.ibm.com) and create your free account. Most of the cloud and cognitive services are for free, so you can learn, develop your models and deploy them for productive use.


![alt text](images/Watson-Homepage.png "IBM homepage")

For this tutirial I used the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) computer vision data set to train our deep learning model to recognize handwritten digits.
The Data set from MNIST can be found [here] (https://github.com/LZRVC/mnist-with-keras-and-watson-studio)
Select the file called mnist-tf-dataset.zip, download it. (see below the content of that file)


![alt text](images/MNIST1.png "COS")


In order to load your training data you must create a Cloud Object Storage instance, to do so process as follow :

Click on the Services item and choose Data services


![alt text](images/COS.png "COS")


From there add/create a new Cloud Object Storage instance


If you have existing Cloud Object Storage, choose that one from the list


![alt text](images/COS1.png "COS2")


The next step is to create buckets in your Cloud Object Storage (COS) and upload your data. Recommendation is to create two buckets (you can also call them containers for your data objects), one for the training data itself and one for the models and results. 
For larger models, more granularity is needed, since the Watson Machine Learning (WML) will load the data from the training data bucket, so you want to avoid unnecessary waiting time and memory consumption for the data which is not used in your training runs.


Select cross-region from Resiliency dropdown menu and from Location dropdown select the one where your Watson Studio instance is, in most cases US or EU.

Remember to create one bucket for testing and one for training

![alt text](images/COS3.png "COS")


Then add the 3 training files into the training bucket
the model & results bucket will be used by WML to store models & log results.


![alt text](images/BucketTraing.png "COS")


## 2-Model the Artificial Neural Network

Using the graphical flow editor in Watson Studio (see below) you can create a new model 


![alt text](images/ModelFlow.png "COS")


Create one with the appropriate options as shown hereafter :


![alt text](images/ModelFlow1.png "COS")


you can assemble your machine learning model or neural network design by dragging and dropping nodes from a palette. In this tutorial, you don't have to design your neural network from scratch. Instead, this tutorial demonstrates how you can import a neural network flow from a predefined flow.

![alt text](images/ModelFlow3.png "COS")


From the toolbar select the import icon and select the file called ModelMNIST.nnd

As a result you should see the following flow in the graphical editor


![alt text](images/ModelFlow4.png "COS")



Double-click the first node, labeled Image Data (this opens the node details side panel.)
In the details side panel, in the DATA section, create a connection to the Cloud Object Storage instance you associated with this project:

1. click Create a new connection.
0. Specify a name for the connection.
0. Click the Create a connection button.
0. Click Back.
0. In the Data Connections drop-down menu, select the Cloud Object Storage connection that you just created.
0. In the Buckets drop-down menu, select the training, test an validata data bucket you created before at step 1.


![alt text](images/ModelFlow6.png "COS")


Finally doucle click the "Adam" node and modifiy the settings as follow


![alt text](images/AdamSettings.png "COS")



Alternatively you can use one of the predefined models available in Watston Studio, to do so Select "From Sample" when you create your model
and choose the appropriate model in our case select Single Convolution layer on MNIST
as shown below


![alt text](images/ModelSample.png "COS")


Therefore proceed as earlier by editing the image data porperties to point to your data set for the training and 


![alt text](images/SINGLE-CNN.png "COS")


## 3-Run it against the trainign data

Now we need to publish our newly created model for training


![alt text](images/ModelFlow5.png "COS")


This creates a New Experiment in your Watson Project

## 4-Score the created model using test/validation data

Train the model using experiment builder
From the home page of your project create a new experiment

In the Machine Learning Service drop-down, select the Watson Machine Learning service instance that is associated with the project.

Configure Cloud Object Storage for this experiment, and select the COS connection you created in step 1.
Map the training & result bucket to the ones created in step 1.

Click Add training definition.
Click the Existing training definitions tab.
From the drop-down menu, select the training definition you published from the flow editor.
Select "1/2 x NVIDIA Tesla K80 (1 GPU)" for the compute plan.
Select "none" for the hyperparameter optimization method.
Click Create and run.


![alt text](images/Training1.png "COS")


Training can take sometimes depending on your watson Machine Learning instance configuration.

By looking at the training results you can monitor the various KPIs of your model and update it if required to maximize its predictive scoring.

Press your training run configuration name to see these elements.


![alt text](images/ModelMonitor.png "COS")


Once done, in the Training Runs tab of experiment builder, under the ACTIONS menu, select "Save model". Then give the model a name and click Save. This stores the model in the Watson Machine Learning repository.


![alt text](images/TrainingRes.png "COS")


In the Assets page of your project in Watson Studio, click the new model in the Models section.

Click the Deployments tab and then click Add Deployment.


## 5-Deploy the model as a Web Service

if you do not intent to export your model as a CoreML on iOS, then you can perform this step to test and invoke your model's REST API with a sample image payload.

To do so, first from your project home click the name of the model you just created under the model section
Click the Deployments tab and then click Add Deployment.
Enter a name for you deployment model such as NumbersML as shown in the screen capture below

![alt text](images/NumbersML-1.png "COS")

Once created you will see under the implementation tab all details related to the depoyed model's Web Service, such as end point, authorization, etc...
thanks to IBM Watson Studio there is a set of code snippets provided in different languages to invoke the model's Web Service (Java, Javascript, python,...).
See screen capture below

![alt text](images/NumbersML-2.png "COS")

Finally you can go to the Test Tab to easily invoke and validate your deployed model web service.
Download a sample JSON sample number payload (part of the github repository called [TestNumber1.json](https://github.com/Luke06/WatsonML-CNN4HandwrittenNum/blob/master/TestNumber1.json) or [TestNumber5.json](https://github.com/Luke06/WatsonML-CNN4HandwrittenNum/blob/master/TestNumber5.json) containing a sample valid image matrix (?,28,28,1) that you can use as primary sample to test your API.
look at the containt of this file in a text editor of your choice if you want to modify it or just understand the structure.


![alt text](images/NumbersML-3.png "COS")


Click on one of the TestNumber link provided and select all the containt, copy it into the clipboard and then from the Test Tab of your deployed Web Service paste it into the form and click on the predict button to get the model prediction results as shown hereafter

![alt text](images/NumbersML-4.png "COS")

As you can see from the values table you get the associated prediction confidence for each number (default index of the table) in the from of a percentage
and here we have a 1 at 99,94%

Now you can build your own application to capture the desired numbers from any device and pass it to your deployed Handwritten prediction model Web Service to get the associated prediction.

Finally if you want to deploy it on an iOS device follow the script hereafter otherwise you're successfully done.



## 5bis-Deploy the model as a Virtual Service

From you project home click on the name of the model you just created under the model section
Click the Deployments tab and then click Add Deployment.
Select Virtual as deployment type and CoreML as format as the goal of this part is to deploy our model onto an Iphone application.

![alt text](images/Deploy.png "COS")

## 6-Export it as a CoreML Apple iOS model

Now that the model is deployed and running in the Watson Machine Learning section we are going to export it as something consumable on the Apple devices : see [CoreML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml) for more details

To do so, click on the deploy model, go to the deployments tab and under ACTIONS select view

![alt text](images/Export.png "COS")

From there select the implementation tab and download the CoreML model

![alt text](images/CoreML.png "COS")


## 7-Embed it into an iphone application


In this tutorial I assume that you have a Mac Laptop and you already have installed the Appple applciation developement tools such as [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) required in this section to build & test the application.
Please make sure you also registered you AppleID as developer as it will be required to build the mobile applicaiton.


Now that we have a trained model compatible with Apple's CoreML framework let's play with it customzing the iphone applicaton develped by [Eridy Lukau](https://github.com/boaerosuke) accessible at this [URL](https://github.com/boaerosuke/digitrecognition_ios) 

Create a folder for this digit recognizer app then download and expand in this directory the entire project components/files.

Open the digitrecognizer project file (called DigitRecognizer.xcodeproj) using XCode and make the following changes :

First you need to replace project's model file called keras_mnist_cnn.mlmodel in the project directory by the one generated at step 6.
I am asking you to do this as when you add a .mlmodel file to your Xcode project, Xcode generates a class for the model with the same base name as the .mlmodel file. So to minimize code modifications I prefer you to use the same model name. 

The other modifcation to be made concern the application code itself regarding the ouptut of the model prediction invocation
in the file called ViewController.m at the following line (embedded wthin JLC comment tag) as followed

<code>
-(void)predictDigit{  
    //unscaled image
    //self.imageToDetect = [[CIImage alloc]initWithImage:self.drawingCanvas.image];
    
    //scaled image to 28x28
    UIImage *scaledCanvasImage = [self imageWithImage:self.drawingCanvas.image scaledToSize:CGSizeMake(28, 28)];
    self.imageToDetect = [[CIImage alloc]initWithImage:scaledCanvasImage];
    
    MLModel *ml_model = [[[keras_mnist_cnn alloc] init] model];
    VNCoreMLModel *vnc_core_ml_model = [VNCoreMLModel modelForMLModel: ml_model error:nil];
    
    VNCoreMLRequest *request = [[VNCoreMLRequest alloc] initWithModel: vnc_core_ml_model completionHandler: (VNRequestCompletionHandler) ^(VNRequest *request, NSError *error){
        NSArray *results = [request.results copy];
        
        //JLC
        VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation *res = ((VNCoreMLFeatureValueObservation *)(results[0]));
        
        NSNumber *prediction = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:0];
        NSNumber *compare= [NSNumber numberWithFloat:0];
        int atIndex = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i<[res.featureValue multiArrayValue].count; i++){
            
            compare = [[res.featureValue multiArrayValue] objectAtIndexedSubscript:i];
            if([compare floatValue] > [prediction floatValue]){
                prediction = compare;
                atIndex = i;
            }
        }
        NSString *result = @"";
        double Ratio = [prediction doubleValue];
        NSNumber *Percent = @(Ratio* 100);
        self.resultLabel.text = [result stringByAppendingFormat: @"I see a : %i at %.2f percent", atIndex, [Percent doubleValue]];
        //JLC
        
        //VNClassificationObservation *res = ((VNClassificationObservation *)(results[0]));
        
        //self.resultLabel.text = [NSString stringWithFormat: @"Recognized Digit : %@", res.identifier];
    }];
</code>
Now you're ready to build and test with the iphone simulator  (7 or Higher) and/or de^loy it on your favorite apple device.

Here is how it looks like, you can see on the screenshot hereafter the app show the predicted score associated to the recognized digit.
